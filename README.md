# Wage Gap Between Asian Men and Women in the United States
ECON 491 Final Project
Srikur Kanuparthy and Payal Rathore

## Research Question
The question that we plan to study with our project is whether a wage gap exists between Asian men and women in the United States. We plan on studying if there is indeed a wage gap and what factors shrink or inflate it, including location, immigration status, and education level.

## Data
The data that we will use for our project comes from the Current Population Survey (CPS) dataset from the international organization IPUMS. The CPS data includes a large amount of publicly available microdata, which are made freely downloadable on their website. The exact data that we plan on using will be that of individuals aged 22 to 60 who identify as Asian only with regards to their ethnicity across a time period of 2009-2022. The relevant metrics of the data that we will use include age, sex, race, Asian subgroup, education, immigration or citizenship status, and income. Preliminary cursory analysis of the data shows that there is enough data to train machine learning models; there are more than 100,000 relevant data points in the data that has been collected. However, the data will need to be cleaned and prepared for use with the machine learning models we plan on using. The response variable will be income and we will study how it varies across Asian men and women based on the other demographic variables.

## Machine Learning
To incorporate machine learning into our project, we plan on using the data to build models with the end goal of predicting income based on the various demographic variables included in the study. We will build multiple models, ranging from simple multiple linear regression to deep learning, to compare the performances of the models and assess their inference abilities.
